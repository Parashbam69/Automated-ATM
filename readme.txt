This is an automated banking system where you create account, delete account,  load money, withdraw money, user can check their own activity details and one account is there for the private use where there will be only access to the private member of atm . the id password of that is in the code in the privated activity function. with help of that you can check the remaining money in the atm and also the every users log activity.

I have used the email for verification we can also use the mobile number but need to buy the API for this you can if you want to
kindly change the email and password in the account to your's so that it can access your account and send it to the users.

Notice;- You also need to turn on less secure app of your google account. Don't worry it's not that harmful if you still want to turn off you can turn it off later. 

It's a simple program if you think some improvement is needed you can commit and push it.
